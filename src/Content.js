        intertextuality: "Allende refers to how the male sexual organs are perceived from a story she once heard, stating “... nevertheless [the male sexual organ] demands respect. It is no exaggeration to say that you can’t go very far without stepping into sacred territory” (97). Allende’s excerpt can be viewed as not only talking about the male sexual organ, but also on the issue of how respect given is different between men and women. Jane the Virgin shows the viewer a different set of female figures; these characters, such as Jane, Xiomara, Petra, and Alba, all show many aspects of independence, strength, and control not commonly seen in typical TV shows. These strong female characters help show the correct approach in how men and women should be respected as equals in all aspects, arguing against “The Butcher” story presented by Allende.",

        intertextuality: "In Kanellos’ writing “Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage”, he explains how the work of Latinos was often erased or completely forgotten, despite Latinos participating in every facet of American culture, helping shape what it has become today. This is primarily due to political and racial reasons, where pieces of work were often selected to be the “original” source, if the name in question was not that of a non-traditional, colored last name. These sources that were coined the “original” sources often would be the pieces that would be included in schools, libraries and museums. This type of erasure of credit towards an author’s work is similar to that of ghostwriting, which Jane in Jane the Virgin was at one point doing for Petra. Jane was paid by Petra to be her author, but Jane would have no credit within the source of the book that would be printed. It would be Petra who would be shown as the author, even though Petra did not do the writing. Ghostwriting is inherently similar to that of how Latino’s pieces of work has been erased or forgotten about by American culture, often due to how Latino pieces would be foundational to the creation of other pieces that would become preferred sources of text within a traditional American setting.",

        intertextuality: "In Marquez’s writing “A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings”, he shows various elements of magical realism, which is the genre of mixing reality with magic, such as an old man having great, angelic wings, or a woman with half of her body being that of a spider. These types of elements, which are not natural to reality, are also shown in Jane the Virgin. In many episodes across the seasons, we see Jane talk to her alter egos or see magical stars appear as if they’re dazzling over people. This is a form of magical realism, in which the show tries to use these elements to highlight thoughts, people, and situations. With Marquez’s writing, although he tells a story of amazing phenomena happening within the village, he is actually discussing how magical realism is often presented and then forgotten about until another new element comes into a scene. The same can be understood by Jane the Virgin, where we often forget what form of magical realism was happening, since the next element would come into play shortly after. Magical realism is often short lived for an audience, but plays an important part in Latin American literature.",

        intertextuality: "In Martin-Rodriguez’s writing, “Life in Search of Readers”, he tells us how writers of Mexican American literature came to be without much guidance or a set path to follow. There would be overlap of who was the true first writer, issues dealing with how to expose their work to a more universal audience, as well as developing a system of exchange so that other readers of Mexican American descent could read works created from people within their culture. In particular, the issue that came up in Martin-Rodriguez’s piece dealing with how to correctly expose Mexican American culture in a way a universal audience would understand, also occurred in Jane the Virgin. Jane would be constantly battling within herself and with her advisor how to correctly tell the story of her novel in a way that not only captivates the audience, but helps them understand many specific points and situations that they might not have ever experienced themselves. We would witness her internal dialogue and strife that would occur anytime she was frustrated or had a new idea of how to retell or add on to her story.",
